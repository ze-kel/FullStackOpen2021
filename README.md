### Full Stack open 2021

[Full Stack Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) by the University of Helsinki. It's free and exceptionally high quality. I can recommend it to anyone interested in Node/React/JS development.

The final project from part 7 was modified in a [separate repo](https://github.com/ze-kel/FullStackOpen2021-deploy) and [deployed to heroku](https://kirill-fullstack-p7-deploy.herokuapp.com/blogs).

I skipped extra part 10(React Native).

Additional repo for practicing GitHub actions from part 11 is [here](https://github.com/ze-kel/full-stack-open-pokedex).
